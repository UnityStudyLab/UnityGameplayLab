# UnityGameplayLab

UnityGameplayLab is a study-oriented repository focused on gameplay algorithms,
game mathematics, and system-level design patterns implemented in Unity.
This lab documents concepts, experiments, and implementations learned through
hands-on practice and technical research.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to deepen understanding of how games work under
the hood by studying and implementing:

- Core gameplay algorithms
- Mathematical foundations used in game systems
- Combat and balance formulas
- Data-driven and scalable system architectures

All examples are implemented using Unity and written with clarity and reusability in mind.

## Topics Covered

This lab explores a wide range of gameplay-related topics, including but not limited to:

- Game mathematics (vectors, probability, interpolation, curves)
- Gameplay algorithms (state machines, turn systems, cooldown logic)
- Combat system formulas (damage, critical hits, scaling, balance)
- Randomness and probability systems (RNG control, weighted chances)
- Simulation and system modeling
- Data-driven gameplay design

## Study Approach

Each topic is approached with the following workflow:

1. Concept research and theory study
2. Mathematical or algorithmic breakdown
3. Unity-based implementation
4. Testing, tuning, and validation
5. Documentation and reflection

This repository serves both as a personal knowledge base
and as a reference for future gameplay system development.
